= 1.0 Prerequisites =

You must have Ant 1.8.1 and Java 1.6 installed.  We also provide .project and .classpath files for Eclipse, although that IDE is not mandatory for development. 

= 2.0 Installation =

== 2.1 Run Ant to install libraries required for compilation ==

After checkout out the sources from SVN, or else downloading the distribution, you must start by invoking "ant" at the top level of the project:

{{{
% ant
}}}

 This will do the following:

 * Download Ivy.
 * Use Ivy to download packages required for compilation, including JUnit and Robocode. 
 * Compile the system.

== 2.2 Verify installation ==

Once compilation is successful, perform a "verification" of the system as follows:

{{{
% ant -f verify.build.xml
}}}

This command will run JUnit, Checkstyle, PMD, !JavaDoc, and !FindBugs, and fail the build if any warnings are issued by these tools.  It will also download these packages using Ivy.  

== 3.0 Development Guidelines ==

Once you have verified your local installation of robocode-sht-michelangelo, you are ready for development.    We follow these development guidelines:

  * We use Eclipse for development, and format the code using [http://ics-software-engineering.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/configfiles/eclipse.format.xml this format]. 

  * For new features, please add an Issue that specifies what you plan to do. 

  * Please develop a JUnit test case (either before, during, or after) development of a new feature to ensure it works.

  * Before committing changes, please make sure that "ant -f verify.build.xml" runs successfully.
